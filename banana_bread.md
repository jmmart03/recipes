title: "Banana bread"
tags: dessert, baking

ingredients:
- 1 3/4 cups (8oz | 235g) all-purpose flour
- 3/4 cup (5oz | 150 g) granulated white sugar
- 1/4 cup (2oz | 50g) brown sugar
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon cinnamon
- 3 medium ripe bananas (about 1 pound or 500g)
- 2 large eggs lightly beaten
- 1/2 cup (4oz | 115 grams) unsalted butter melted and cooled (or cooking oil)
- 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
- 1 cup (6 oz | 175 g) chocolate chips (or roughly chopped nuts of your choice)

directions:

- Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C). Lightly grease a 9 x 5 x 3 inch loaf pan and line with parchment (baking) paper. Set aside.
- In a large bowl whisk together the flour, sugars, baking soda, salt and cinnamon. Set aside.
- In a separate medium-sized bowl mash the bananas really well. Then add the eggs, cooled melted butter (or oil), and vanilla.
- Using a wooden spoon or spatula lightly fold the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients until just combined. Gently fold in half of the chocolate chips (or nuts if using). The batter should be thick and lumpy. (Do not over mix!)
- Pour the batter into prepared pan and top with remaining chocolate chips or nuts. Bake for 55-60 minutes, or until bread is golden brown and a toothpick inserted in the centre comes out clean. 
- After about a half an hour, turn out onto a wire rack to cool. 
- Serve warm or at room temperature.
